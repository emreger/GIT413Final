                <p>This project is a website that highlights photos that were taken by me. It features 
                    some JavaScript features such as a gallery selection, dark mode option, a form and 
                    a game. The gallery selection will only show the image based on the button that the 
                    viewer chooses. The form uses RegExp to validate if the form is filled out properly. 
                    The game feature will use a random number generator and compares the number chosen 
                    to the number generated if the number matches the user will win.</p>
